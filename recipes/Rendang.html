    <h2>What is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rendang" target="_blank">Rendang?</a></h2>
    <p>Beef Rendang is a Indonesian curry and is considered by many to be the king of all curries! To say its extravagantly delicious is an understatement.</p><p>
        There are very few curries in this world with such amazingly complex flavours.</p>

        <li>1 1/2 tbsp fresh ginger, minced</li>
        <li>2 tbsp oil (vegetable, canola or peanut oil)</li>

        <h2>Curry</h2>
        <li>2 lb/ 1 kg chuck steak, or other slow cooking beef, cut into 4cm / 1.6" cubes </li>
        <li>1 tbsp oil (vegetable, peanut, canola)</li>

        <li>1/2 tsp cardamon powder</li>
        <li>1 lemongrass stick, bottom half of the stick only and smashed</li>
        <li>400ml / 14 oz coconut milk</li>
        <li>2 tsp tamarind puree / paste, or tamarind pulp soaked in 1 tbsp of hot water, seeds removed</li>
        <li>4 large kaffir lime leaves (or 6 small) , very finely sliced </li>
        <li>1/3 cup desiccated coconut (finely shredded coconut)</li>
        <li>1 tbsp brown sugar or grated palm sugar</li>
        <li>1 1/2 tsp salt</li>

    </ul>

    <h2><em>Instructions</em></h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Place Spice Paste ingredients in a small food processor and whizz until fine.</li>
        <li>Heat 1 tbsp oil in a large heavy based pot over high heat. Add half the beef and brown,</li>
        then remove onto plate. Repeat with remaining beef.
        <li>Lower heat to medium low. Add Spice Paste and cook for 2 - 3 minutes until </li>
        the wetness has reduced and the spice paste darkens
        <li>Add remaining Curry ingredients and beef. Stir to combine.</li>
        <li>Bring to simmer, then immediately turn down the heat to low or medium low so the sauce is bubbling very gently.</li>
        <li>Put the lid on the pot and leave it to simmer for 1 hr 15 minutes.</li>
        <li>Remove lid and check the beef to see how tender it is. You don't want it to be "fall apart at a touch" at this stage,</li>
        but it should be quite tender. If it is fall apart already, remove the beef from the pot before proceeding.
        <li>Turn up heat to medium and reduce sauce for 30 - 40 minutes, stirring every now and then at first, </li>
        then frequently towards the end until the beef browns and the sauce reduces to a paste that coats the beef.
        <li>The beef should now be very tender, fall apart at a touch. If not, add a splash of water and keep cooking.</li>
        Remove from heat and serve with plain or Restaurant Style Coconut Rice.
